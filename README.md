This is the very first "project" of TheOdinProject's Web Development 101 course, http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css.

The exercise is to make the Google homepage. I have added a sweet "CUSTOM" logo, please do not be too
jealous of my artistic skills. 

Skills demonstrated in this exercise include basic HTML and CSS and basic CSS Flex.

This is obviously very rough, and I'm sure my CSS is organized horribly, but I hope to learn to make this
a hundred times better as I progress.
